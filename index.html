        <p1>Did you know that one of the most brilliant scientists in history, **Ernest Rutherford**, hailed from New Zealand? Born in the small town of **Brightwater** in 1871, Rutherford's journey took him from a simple upbringing to the forefront of nuclear physics. He attended the **University of Canterbury** in Christchurch, where his exceptional talent for science was recognized. His groundbreaking research on radioactivity and the structure of the atom led to him being awarded the **1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry**. Rutherford is famously credited with "splitting the atom," and he is often referred to as the "father of nuclear physics." - Google</p1>
